          <h3>Background</h3>
          <p>
            Amplitude is a product analytics platform that helps teams
            understand why their users convert, engage and retain by enabling
            them to analyze their user behavior data. To get the maximum value
            out of the platform, a clean and understandable data taxonomy is
            absolutely essential.
          </p>

          <h3>The discovery of the data problem</h3>
          <p>
            Since the launch of Amplitude 2.0. We were conducting regular
            usability studies and qualitative user interviews to gather user
            feedback on the product. One of the common issue is that the users
            are having a hard time picking the right events for their analyses.
            This problem is so prevalent that it is mentioned in almost all of
            our user sessions.
          </p>

          <p>
            As you can see in the screenshot, the first step of creating any
            Amplitude analysis is to select an event. Usually the users need to
            pick an event that represents the corresponding to the user action
            they’d like to analyze. Having issues here will result in the user
            not able to get any value out of Amplitude.
          </p>
          <img src="img/taxonomy/selecting-event.png" />
          <div class="caption">
            Users has to figure out which event to select from a (usually long)
            dropdown
          </div>

          <p>
            There are lots of reasons why the users are struggling with the
            event selection step. Our assumption is there are just too many
            events being tracked and it’s extremely difficult to keep track of
            all of them.
          </p>

          <h3>The MVP</h3>
          <p>
            With that assumption in mind, we started out by creating a MVP, an
            event dictionary, as our first solution to the problem. I designed
            an inVision prototype of a centralized event dictionary where all of
            the users within an organization can visit and read documentations
            on their data.
          </p>
          <img src="img/taxonomy/mvp-1.png" />
          <div class="caption">

          <div class="caption">
            Detail page for individual event
          </div>

          <p>
            We then showed this MVP design to our customers during our
            continuous discovery research to get more concrete feedback and
            gather initial user reaction to this design.
          </p>
          <ul>
            We discovered a lot more problems in the data space:
            <li>
              Taxonomy planning is a painful and manual process that uses many
              different tools. Because of that, most organization suffer from
              noisy data due to instrumentation errors, spammy data, different
              naming conventions, etc.
            </li>
            <li>
              Some organizations have an event taxonomy that make it hard to
              take advantage of Amplitude’s advanced analyses.
            </li>
            <li>
              Org admins have no control over sensitive PII data being sent.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h3>
            The start of a new product
          </h3>
          <p>
            We quickly realized there is huge potential to design and build a
            product add-on to improve the experience of taxonomy design and
            management for our customers. This will also generate additional
            revenue opportunities for the company.
          </p>
          <h4>Personas</h4>
          <p>
            We synthesized our learnings in the initial research and decided on
            four personas that will directly benefit from.
          </p>
          <img src="img/taxonomy/personas.png" />
          <div class="caption">
            Target personas
          </div>
          <p>
            We decide to make the Data Governor as the main persona and
            de-prioritize the Instrumentor persona, as most instrumentors won’t
            interact with Amplitude.
          </p>

          <h4>User Journey</h4>
          <p>
            I’ve also created user journey to visualize the current
            instrumentation workflow how different personas work together.
          </p>
          <img src="img/taxonomy/journey-1.png" />
          <div class="caption">

          <div class="caption">
            User journey part 2: Event instrumentation & QA user journey
          </div>
          <p>
            As you can see from the user journey, lots of tedious work are
            involved in the event planning and instrumentation workflow across
            multiple people and many different tools. Mistakes are made
            inevitably during this process and most of which won’t be discovered
            until they are already polluting the production data.
          </p>

          <h4>Three key feature areas</h4>
          <ul>
            Based on the research we’ve narrowed down the features areas to:
            <li>
              Allow novice users to be able to explore and understand the data
              tracked in their organizations
            </li>
            <li>
              Allow data governors and advocates to plan their taxonomy inside
              amplitude, and block any noisy data
            </li>
            <li>
              Allow data governors to manage, delete and fix their taxonomy
              issues after the data has been sent
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            We synthesized our learnings in the initial research and decided on
            four personas that will directly benefit from.

          <h4>V1</h4>
          <p>
            At first, I decide to go with a three-tab approach (Discover, Plan,
            Manage), where each tab is designed with one primary persona and
            their goal in mind.

            architect of the page, as well as explore new features based on user
            feedback.

            Final Beta design
          </div>
          <p>
            Once the beta version is launched, we conducted more user research
            and start gathering feedback.
          </p>
          <img src="img/taxonomy/feedback.png" />
          <div class="caption">
            Sample InVision prototype with customer feedback
          </div>
          <ul>
            We discovered this version has a few issues:
            <li>
              It’s really hard for users to remember which section (Discover,
              plan or manage). Using the marketing names made it a lot worse.
            </li>
            <li>
              The Taxonomy page isn’t the best place for novice users to learn
              about events - there are just too many of them.
            </li>
            <li>
              Despite the good will of the advocates, only a small portion of
              the event descriptions are filled out. It takes too much effort!
            </li>
          </ul>
          <h3>Schema Editor</h3>
          <p>
            Based on the learnings from the first launch, we realized that
            Taxonomy is better to be optimized for data governors as the primary
            persona. We need a unified product where the data governor can do
            almost every thing in one place.
          </p>
          <p>
            We decide to explore the idea of having a centralized schema that’s
            always up-to-date. The admins of the organizations can define and
            manage their taxonomy in the same place.
          </p>
          <img src="img/taxonomy/schema-1.png" />

          </div>

          <p>
            Data governors can edit the live schema to add new events and
            properties or prevent noisy and sensitive data from getting into
            their projects.

          <p>
            To solve the problem of novice users not able to easily selecting
            event, we believe the best solution is to meet the users where they
            are - in the product and analyses. We decide to show event
            definitions right when the users are picking event for their
            analyses.
