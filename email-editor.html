					<h1> Marketo Email Editor </h1>
					<p class="desc"> 
Email Editor is the single most important feature in the entire Marketo product suite. More than 80% of Marketo users are email marketers and they spend the majority of their time inside Marketo Email Editor. In this project, I led the design effort to improve the current email design and editing experience.

					</p>

					<div class="block">
				
							<h4>The Problem</h4>
							The existing Marketo email editing experience is rather cumbersome:

							<ul>
								<li>
									Customers cannot preview and choose the email templates easily in the app. 
								</li>		
								<li>
									The email templates are predefined. Users cannot add or remove sections in their emails. 
								</li>	
								<li>
									Marketo automatically break the email down to many rich-text regions, the user has to manually go into each section and edit the content and styles individually inside a popup.
								</li>	
								<li>
									Itâ€™s the best practice that marketers should always send a plain text version of the email. Currently, the text option is buried in the UI. A lot of times, the marketers will forget to update their text version.
								</li>	
								<li>
									There is no easy way to preview what the email looks like on a mobile device. During my user research, I found that many marketers will preview the email in the email previewer and then manually resize the browser window.
								</li>	
								<li>
									For power users, editing email source code in a popup modal is very inefficient. 
								</li>					
								
							</ul>
					
					</div>
					<div class="block">
						<h4>The Goal</h4>
						<ul>
							
							<li>
								Design a user-friendly email template picking and editing experience.

							</li>
							<li>
								Allow user to change the structure and design of the email easily without the need to modify the code.
							</li>
							<li>
								Provide a better way for users to edit code, plain text version of the email.
							</li>	
							<li>
								Allow users to preview the email in both desktop and mobile view.
							</li>		

							
						</ul>

						<h4>The Challenge</h4>
						<p>
							This project is selected to be featured during the Marketo User Summit in May 2016. We have a very important mission with tight deadline. As a UX designer, I had to work very closely with the PM and engineers to keep adjusting the project scope and come up the best design solution within the time and resources allowed.
						</p>		
					</div>
					<div class="block">
						<h4>The Result</h4>
						<p>
							I presented the final design to a panel of executives and product stakeholders. The design was well-received. It is currently being implemented.
