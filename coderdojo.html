					<h1> CoderDojo NYC Website Redesign </h1>

									Due to the organization’s unique situations, CoderDojo NYC has a rather unique signing up process for events. This process, however, did not get explained clearly on the website.

								<li>
									CoderDojo NYC has two newsletters and it was not clearly marked or explained on the website. Parents and volunteers often sign up for the wrong mailing list.

							<h3>Ideation</h3>
							<p>After a few initial meetings with the co-founders, I discovered that the organization is receiving an overwhelming amount emails from confused parents inquiring about the information stated on the website. Being a 100% volunteer-based company, they don’t the resources needed to take care of such emails. In addition, CoderDojo NYC has two different newsletters: one for parents and one for volunteers. Parents and volunteers often sign up for the wrong newsletter.
