					<h1> CoderDojo NYC Website Redesign </h1>
					<p class="desc"> CoderDojo NYC is non-profit organization hosting free Science, Technology, Engineering, Art and Math (STEAM) workshops for youth aged 7-17. I was thrilled, as a volunteer designer, to help them refresh their website. </p>


					<div class="block">
				
							<h4>The Problem</h4>
						
							<ul>
								<li>
									With the original CoderDojo NYC website the sign-up flow supported both signup for particpants and volunteers and was overly convoluted.  Parents would spend time searching on the site to figure out how to sign up and then, upon failing, would sign up as a volunteer.  Things were further complicated when the parents would also send an email asking to sign up for the workshop and were confused why they were getting emails about volunteering.
								</li>							
								
							</ul>
					
					</div>
					<div class="block">
						<h4>The Goal</h4>
						<ul>
							<li>
									Enter Ran.  I focused on two fundamental concepts: findability and usability.
								</li>
							<li>
								Reduce the number of inqury emails:
								<ul>
									<li>
										Better explain the sign up processes for both parents and volunteers.  
									</li>
									
									<li>
										Reorganize the site content to improve findability.
									</li>
							
								</ul>
							</li>
							<li>
								Refresh the website's visual style, so the site looks current and appropriate. 
							</li>

							
						</ul>
					</div>
					<div class="block">
						<h4>The Result</h4>
						<p>
							The stakeholders are satisfied with my service and the final design. The design is accepted and is currently being developed.

						<h2 class="section-header text-center">Process</h2>
							<div class="row">
								<h3>Scenario</h3>
								<p>To help me think from a site userâ€™s perspective, I created two user scenarios. These are the primary use cases of the two user groups that my design will be optimized for. 
								</p>
								<div class="text-center">
									<img class="img-responsive" src="img/coderdojo/User-Scenario.png" alt="User Scenarios">
								</div>
							</div>
							<div class="row">
								<h3>Information Architecture</h3>
								
								<p>I started by creating a content inventory of all the information Coderdojo presented at their current website. Then I set up an <a href="https://www.optimalworkshop.com/optimalsort/2frm5728/coderdojo/shared-results/53v6b13s5j1lcha4pa8epx7o3585p240" target="_blank">online card sorting project</a> using Optimal Workshop. I have recruited 11 participants (2 of them abandoned the sorting during their sessions, but I've included some of their data in my result analysis). I analyzed the results using the Similarity Matrix and Dendrograms provided by Optimal Workshop.

									<img class="col-sm-6 col-xs-12 img-responsive" src="img/coderdojo/dendrogram.png">
								</div>
							</div>

							<div>
								<p> Based on the data, I designed the new global navigation. </p>
								<div class="text-center">
									<img class="img-responsive" src="img/coderdojo/nav.png">
								</div>
							</div>
							<div>
								<p> And also reorganized the site content into a new sitemap. </p>
								<div class="text-center">
									<img class="img-responsive" src="img/coderdojo/sitemap.png">
								</div>
							</div>

							<div class="row">
								<h3>Ideation</h3>
								<p>After buttoned down the Information Architecture, I started sketching and wireframing. I started with quick and messy sketches to generate as many ideas as possible. After I got something I really like, I started to sketch with a bit more details.

									<img class="col-sm-4 col-xs-12 img-responsive" src="img/coderdojo/sketch-1.jpg">
								</div>
							</div>
							<div class="row">
								<h3>Mid-fi Mockups</h3>
								<p>I fleshed out a few key pages and created mid-fi mockups to gather input from the stakeholders. 
								</p>
								<div class="text-center">

									<img class="col-sm-6 col-xs-12 img-responsive" src="img/coderdojo/Parents-v1.png">								
								</div>
								
					
								<p>Then I consolidated the feedbacks from my client and finalized the visual design after a few more iterations.

							<h3>Better illustrated process</h3>
							<p>I've tried a few different way to show the process on the website, I ended us using a series of custom-made icons to visualize the steps they would take. Along with text explaination (both title and microcopy), the process are very easy to understand.

							<h3>Page for targeted users</h3>
							<p>In the global navigation bar of the new design, I clearly dedicated the first two spots for parents and volunteers. In each page, I've included all the information for each user group in their corresponding page. So once they get to the page, they are able to find everything they need to know.

						</div>				
						<div class="row">
							<h3>Adding FAQs to the Contact Us page</h3>
							<p> The stakeholders had expressed to me multiple times that people will email and ask the same questions over and over again. I decided to add a list of such questions on top of the contact form. That is, the user needs to go though this list of questions before they can submit a question to the organization. However, I couldn't test and varify this design decision just yet. Once the site is published, we can then monitor the number of emails we got and I can tweak the design if needed.
