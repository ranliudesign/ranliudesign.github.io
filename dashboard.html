				<h1> Email Marketing Dashboard </h1>
				<p class="desc">The Email Marketing dashboard enables email marketers to gain powerful insights from bother real-time and historical data. This project is inspired by a project I've worked on at Marketo. I was leading the design initiative at Marketo to re-imagine the next generation of Marketo Analytics. However, the scope of the project grew to big for the resource at the time and I have to hand it over to a different team. However, I am still passionate about this project and it inspired me to continue designing as a personal passion project.</p>

						<h4>The Problem</h4>
					
						<ul>
							<li>
								[TODO]Email marketers need to keep track of a dozen metrics of their marketing emails, opens, clicks, click-through rate etc. Most of the current Marketing Automation softwares represent such metrics in a grid. It is nearly imposibble for marketers to distill any insight from the sea of numbers. Some power users and enterprise companies will tap in to the powerful Business Inteligence tools to furture analyze these data, but for most marketers, it is not necessary and difficult.

						</ul>

					<h4>The Goal</h4>
					<ul>
						<li>
							Reduce the number of inqury emails:
							<ul>
								<li>
									Better explain the sign up processes for both parents and volunteers.  
								</li>
								
								<li>
									Reorganize the site content to improve findability.
								</li>
						
							</ul>
						</li>
						<li>
							Refresh the website's visual style, so the site looks current and appropriate. 
						</li>

						
					</ul>
