				<h1> Email Marketing Dashboard </h1>
				<p class="desc">The Email Marketing dashboard enables email marketers to gain powerful insights from bother real-time and historical data. This project is inspired by a project I've worked on at Marketo. I was leading the design initiative at Marketo to re-imagine the next generation of Marketo Analytics. Sadly, the scope of the project grew too big for the product team to handle at the time and I have to hand it over to a contract team. But my passion about this project inspired me to continue designing and finishing this project as a personal passion project.</p>

						<h4>The Problem</h4>
					
						<ul>
							<li>
								Email marketers need to keep track of a dozen metrics of their marketing emails every day: opens, clicks, click-through rate etc. Most of the current Marketing software represent such metrics in a plain data grid. It is nearly imposibble for marketers to distill any insight from the sea of numbers. Some power users and enterprise companies will tap in to the powerful Business Inteligence tools to further analyze these data, but for most marketers, it is not needed.
							</li>							
						</ul>
				
				</div>
				<div class="block">
					<h4>The Goal</h4>
					<ul>
						<li>
							Design a Email Marketing Dashboard for email marketers to better understand their email performance data. </li>
							
						<li>
							The dashboard should be intuitive to understand and use. Marketers should be able to gain a deeper understanding of their data without becoming experts in data science.
						</li>
						
						<li>
							Easy and fast filtering, so they can easily report on the emails they care about. Even if it's for Enterprise-grade companies.
						</li>						
					</ul>
				</div>
				<div class="block">
					<h4>The Deliverables</h4>
					<p>
						Persona Documents, Sketches, Mid-fi Wireframes, Stylestiles, Hi-fi Design Mockups.

					<h3>Design Guideline - <a href="http://www.ifp.illinois.edu/nabhcs/abstracts/shneiderman.html">Shneiderman's Mantra </a></h3>
					<p> 
						I have the pleasure to work with Dr. Ben Shneiderman during my graduate studies on a handful of information visualization projects. His mantra became my go to guideline for any visualization/dashboard projects. 
					</p>
					<div class="text-center">
						<img class="img-responsive" src="img/dashboard/mantra.png" alt="User Scenarios">
					</div>
					<ul>
						<li><b>Overview first</b>: When marketers landed into the dashboard, they should get an overview of their overall email performance. The data presented on the dashboard should be enough to answer the question “how am I doing?” immediately. </li>
						<li><b>Zoom and filter</b>: After the initial bird-eye view of the data, patterns, outlier and additional questions might emerge. The dashboard should have enough functions for user to dig into the data and find out more.</li>
						<li><b>details on demand</b>: Marketers should be able to get the details on all things visualized in the dashboard. In the some cases, marketers may want to see the actual data, the dashboard should be able to support that. </li>

					</ul>
					
				</div>
				
				<div class="row">
					<h3>Persona</h3>
					<p> I have interviewed eight digital email marketers on their reporting needs, and I developed the following two personas. Naomi is the primary persona, and Amanda is the secondary persona.
					</p>
					<div class="text-center">
						<img class="col-md-6 col-sm-12 img-responsive" src="img/dashboard/naomi.png" alt="Persona Naomi">
						<img class="col-md-6 col-sm-12 img-responsive" src="img/dashboard/amanda.png" alt="Persona Amanda">
					</div>

				</div>
				<div class="row">
					<h3>Dashboard Content</h3>
					<p> 
						From my previous interviews, I got a really good idea on what content that email marketers would like to see in such a dashboard. These data can be categorized as:
					</p>

					<ul>
						<li>Key email performance metrics 
							<ul>
								<li>Performance metrics: open rate, click through rate, unsubscribes etc.</li>
								<li>Delivery metrics: soft bounces, hard bounces, delivery rate etc.</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
						<li>Break down of performance/delivery metrics overtime. </li>
						<li>Performance for a certain type of emails</li>
						<li>A different grouping of data, such as group by region/country</li>
					</ul>
					
				</div>
				<div class="row">
					<h3>Ideation</h3>
					<p> I decided to I started by sketching ideas of the overall layout based on the content. I decided on a layout that consists of two views, one is the overview, one is the data view.
					</p>
					<div class="text-center">
						<img class="img-responsive" src="img/dashboard/sketches.png" alt="sketches">
					</div>
					<p> I then drill down to each portion of the overview, deciding on the chart types. 
					</p>
					<div class="text-center">
						<img class="img-responsive" src="img/dashboard/charts.png" alt="chart type sketches">
					</div>

				</div>
				<div class="row">
					<h3>Wireframe</h3>
					<p> I then started to wireframe the sketches, keep iterating and tweaking the content and interactions.
					</p>
					<div class="text-center">
						<img class="col-md-6 col-sm-12 img-responsive" src="img/dashboard/summary-wire.png" alt="Persona Naomi">
						<img class="col-md-6 col-sm-12 img-responsive" src="img/dashboard/detail-wire.png" alt="Persona Amanda">
					</div>

				</div>
				<div class="row">
					<h3>Style Exploration</h3>
					<p> I decided to create a few styletiles to play with different themes for the dashboard.
					</p>
					<div class="text-center">
						<img class="col-md-6 col-sm-12 img-responsive" src="img/dashboard/light-soft.png" alt="Persona Naomi">

					<div class="row">
						<h3>Most Important to Least Important</h3>
						<p>A lot of software dashboards are just a series of chart tiles in no particular order. But I wanted to try to find a logical way to orgainze the data in the dashboard. And I have achieved that in my final design:
						</p>
						<ul>
							<li>The most important items are the key performance metrics, and they are at the top of the page. So a marketer can simply glance the row and immediately know "how are my emails doing?". From left to right, the most important metrics for the email marketers is click-through rate, it is displayed the first, with different styling elements.</li>
							<li>The time series chart is slightly less important, but still important enough to be fit on the summary page.</li>
							<li>To the right of the time series chart, I have the top performing emails. Top performing emails list is a "nice to have", and it's mainly for the secondary persona (Amanda, VP of Marketing). It's the least important item on the summary page and it's placed in the lower-right corner.</li>
							<li>For the rare cases that a marketers need to dig into the data, the original data grid of all metrics are in a second view (Details tab).
						</ul>
						
					</div>	
					<div class="row">
						<h3>The small things</h3>
						<ul>
						<li> I have added a lot of small things to help marketers better understanding their data. It's easy to just show a number on the dashboard, such as click-through rate is 32%. But is this number good or bad? In the dashboard design, I added a benchmark comparison to show if the performance is better or worse than the comparison period they've selected, by default, the benchmark is set to be the previous period.
						</li>
						<li>To make data easy to scan, I've rounded all numbers for display. For example, the click through rate is 32.64%, but I only show 32% in the circular bar chart. The exact number is revealed in the tooltips. </li>
						
						</ul>
						<img class="col-md-3 col-sm-6 img-responsive" src="img/dashboard/benchmark.png" alt="Persona Naomi">
						<img class="col-md-3 col-sm-6 img-responsive" src="img/dashboard/tooltip2.png" alt="Persona Amanda">
						<img class="col-md-6 img-responsive" src="img/dashboard/tooltip-1.png" alt="Persona Naomi">
